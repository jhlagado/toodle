## Adventures in To-Doing

This is an extremely simplistic Todo list app that uses Redux for its state management and Material Design Lite CSS framework to do the UI. I'm using reference store logic with Jest tests. The Redux business logic is also being used in the React Native ex2a repo.

It's a CRA app so simply check out and run:

```bash
npm start
